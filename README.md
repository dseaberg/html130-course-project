### SEO
Improvements implemented:
1. Usage of semantic HTML elements
2. Additional metadata in the base index.html

Improvements still to do:
1. Better mobile friendliness. Usage of Bootstrap helps, but the layout could still be better in a mobile view.
2. Adding a sitemap so that search engines can more easily be aware of changes to the site.
